# DNA-to-RNA-and-Protein-Sequence-Translator
This Python project models transcription and translation by converting DNA to RNA and then to proteins using codons and a genetic code map. It includes input validation, handles stop codons, and uses modular functions, reinforcing bioinformatics and molecular biology concepts.
# DNA to RNA and Protein Sequence Translator

## Overview
This Python project simulates biological transcription and translation processes by converting a DNA sequence into its corresponding RNA sequence and then translating the RNA into a protein sequence. It demonstrates core bioinformatics concepts using programming to model the central dogma of molecular biology.

## Features
- Converts DNA sequences to RNA by replacing thymine (T) with uracil (U).
- Translates RNA sequences into protein sequences using a standard genetic code dictionary.
- Detects stop codons to terminate protein synthesis accurately.
- Handles unknown or invalid codons by marking them as '?'.
- Provides basic input validation and user-friendly prompts.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3 (no external dependencies)

## Installation
1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.
2. Download the project script `dna_to_protein.py` (or your filename).
3. Run the script via command line or IDE.

## Usage
1. Execute the script:2. When prompted, enter the DNA sequence (only A, T, C, G characters).
3. View the RNA and translated protein sequences generated by the program.

## Implementation Approach and Key Learnings
The project converts DNA to RNA by replacing thymine with uracil to replicate transcription. It then iterates through the RNA sequence in codons of three nucleotides, translating each codon into the corresponding amino acid using a lookup dictionary until a stop codon is reached.

Key takeaways include a practical understanding of genetic information flow, string manipulations in Python, handling biological edge cases such as stop codons and invalid inputs, and structuring code with readable, reusable functions. This helped bridge theoretical biology with computational bioinformatics techniques.

## Testing
- Input different DNA sequences with known protein products to ensure accurate translation.
- Verify that translation stops correctly at stop codons.
- Confirm the program warns when invalid characters are present in input.
