# DNA-to-RNA-and-Protein-Sequence-Translator
This Python project models transcription and translation by converting DNA to RNA and then to proteins using codons and a genetic code map. It includes input validation, handles stop codons, and uses modular functions, reinforcing bioinformatics and molecular biology concepts.
